                        If there is one thing you should know about me it is that I absolutely love learning new things. For me, it feels so exciting to 
                        learn something new, something true, that my natural inclination is to share it with everyone. I consistently, challenge myself and 
                        my perceptions to discover truth. This habit has greatly enriched my life, mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and socially.

                    <p>
                        After my mission to Raliegh North Carolina, I returned to BYU, and met my wife Kristin as we both taught the same class of missionaries 
                        at the MTC. After receiving my BS in Business Management, Kristin and I and our 13 month old Rebecca moved to Mesa Arizona, Kristin’s home town.

                    <p>
                        My first career experience allowed me to rapidly gain experience leading business software implementation and exposed me to the wonders of web 
                        application development. My second child Allyse was born. Two years into my career, I stepped down from my executive project management position 
                        to accept a Jr software developer position with responsibility for the enterprise business software that ran our small professional employer business. 
                        In the wake of the economic devastation of 9/11 our small business finally closed its doors in the spring of 2003 and my new full time job, was looking 
                        for one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My impressive although shallow resume, allowed me to secure many interviews in business, and technology, however when it got down to the final 
                        round, someone else was always chosen. During this difficult and miraculous time, I started pursuing a Masters degree, accepted a position as 
                        an Academic Counselor with University of Phoenix Online, became a Purchasing Assistant for a Residential Homebuilder and started two LLC’s Signature 
                        Creations LLC and Orbsi Services LLC. I had pretty much given up on working in the software engineering industry when I got a call, interview and job 
                        offer for a Solution Developer position with Axciom corporation. I felt less than enthused with the offer as it was not the area of technology I was 
                        interested in, but it was a technology position. I accepted the position, continued to work on my Master’s in Information Systems Engineering degree 
                        and became the father of our 3rd child Nathan. I volunteered to manage an enterprise Java application that no one else on our team wanted and worked 
                        my way into leading a small Java web application development project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project prepared me to accept a mid-level java developer position with a team tasked with migrating az.gov Links to an external site. from 
                        IBM to NIC Arizona. I suspected it would be super intense and give me the software development experience I longed for and boy, was I right. I was 
                        having the time of my professional life and finished my Master’s degree. These experiences let me work on a number of other cool projects in different 
                        industries, including geospatial, education, mobile advertising, and back to finance. My most notable career contribution to date came as an Enterprise 
                        Software Engineer on the team that made the first dollar transfer from one mobile phone to another over the Zelle network. I enjoy mindfulness, meditation, ballroom dancing, reading, martial arts, hiking, camping and spending time with my family.
